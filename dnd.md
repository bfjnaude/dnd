## Items

<details><summary>Windvane</summary>

Weapon (spear), legendary (requires attunement) 

A silver spear, Windvane has dark sapphires on the filigreed surface of its polished head. Held by its shining haft, the weapon feels insubstantial, as if clutching a cool, gently blowing breeze. The spear contains a spark of Yan-C-Bin, the Prince of Evil Air.

You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage you make with this magic weapon, which has the finesse weapon property. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.

Air Mastery. You gain the following benefit while you hold Windvane:

* You can speak Auran fluently.
* You have resistance to lightning damage.
* You can cast dominate monster (save DC 17) on an air elemental. Once you have done so, Windvane canâ€™t be used in this way agin until the next dawn.
