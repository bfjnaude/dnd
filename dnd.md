<summary> Twelfth session: Giants & revelations </summary>

#### 1st of Flamerule 1453

After a bit of a detour the adventuring band find a trail heading NW to SE. They decide to set up camp a couple of
minutes off the trail and rest for the night.

The watch schedule is decided after dark an the group begin to rest. Their rest is interrupted by a wraith, that nearly
drains the monk of all her life's essense, before she can alert the rest of the party. The wraith however seems more
focused on the bard and allows the monk to narrowly escape. Something about his dagger...

The party kills the wraith, of whom they assume is Bastion. Rest is resumed.

#### 2nd of Flamerule 1453

The party decides to follow the trail NW in the direction, of what they assume is, Red Larch.

During the day, they spot large vultures in the distance. The bard recalls their encounters with the Feathergale Knights
and decides to rather head in the direction of Feathergale Spire, barely visible in the distance, to ask for aid.

On their way to the spire, the party is attacked by three vulture-mounted riders. After dealing with the riders and
their mounts, it finally starts to sink in that the Feathergale Knights weren't the gracious hosts they had first
assumed. The party finds that the knights' clothing is covered in symbols of the Cult of Howling Hatred. Following this
revelation, the group starts heads back to the trail, to get to Red Larch.

Getting to Red Larch takes the rest of the day's light. The party arrives in the ruins of Red Larch, exhausted and
relieved. The town has been deserted after the devastating attacks by the elemental cults left the ground cracked and
many of the buildings torn open. The party make their way to the main road and start looting the Swinging Sword Inn. The
bard and the dwarf promptly start looting the bar and singing songs. Meanwhile the druid and monk decided to use the
inn's remaining supplies to make a stew in a large couldron hanging in the inn's hearth.

After the merry making and supper, the group decide to hold up in one of the inn's larger rooms, on the second floor,
for the night.

#### 3rd of Flamerule 1453

Getting an early start, the party starts to loot the rest of the towns ruins for supplies. They equip themselves with
any clothes and adventuring gear they are able to find in workshops and traders supplies which were abandoned during the
evacuation of Red Larch.

While they are busy looting, a fire giant enters the town. Yasheira is quick on the uptake and alerts the party of the
giant's presence. The giant starts to search the town, ripping the roofs off houses and beckoning whomever is hiding to
come out and give him Tinderstrike. He seems aware of the dagger's presence.

The party stays in hiding and springs their ambush from inside a general trader's store. Using a combination of stuns,
confusion and summoned creatures the party is able to overwhelm the giant before he can deal any serious damage, with
the dwarf delivering the final blow.

</details>

### Wed 14 August 2019

<details>
<summary> Thirteenth session: It's getting hot in here </summary>

#### 3rd of Flamerule 1453

The gang decides to set off to the North, with plans to make their way to Neverwinter via the Triboar trail.

Not long after starting the long trek across the Dessarin Valley, they spot large columns of smoke on the horizon. It
soon becomes apparent that a wild fire is blazing across the Sumber Hills, travelling in their direction. The air starts
to become acrid and the sky becomes dark and hazy as the wall of fire, stretching from West to East as far as they can
see, approaches.

The party decides to run back to Red Larch, to escape the approaching inferno. During their retreat they notice that a
column of fire is approaching from the West. Not long after, they spot a fiery flying streak in to the East, followed by
a trail of fire on the ground. Something is trying to burn down the valley.

With some encouraging words from the bard, the group picks up the pace to attempt to avoid whatever is trying to trap
them in the inferno.

The encounter comes to a head, with the party narrowly escaping a strafing run by a red dragon, wreathed in flame.

Combat ensues, with Thorin launching crossbow bolts; Moonpie hurling magical beams of frost and lightning; Peren
dazzling and confusing the dragon with psychic song; and Yasheira delivering stunning, ki empowered, strikes. This young
red dragon seems to alternate between a physical and elemental form, rendering many of the party’s attacks ineffective.

The dragon gets in a few devastating blows with its claws and nearly kills the druid with its fire breath, before being
slain. The final blow is delivered by Peren, wielding Tinderstrike. The dragon dies in a bright explosion, as the dagger
is plunged into its hide. The group is blinded, deafened and knocked backwards by the blast. Peren’s arm is left
scorched black and pulsing with fiery veins. All that remains of the dragon is a charred skeleton.

After slaying the dragon the gang continues their retreat to Red Larch. They must devise another plan if they are to
escape the Dessarin Valley.

They decide to, once again, take refuge in the Swinging Sword Inn. The druid and the monk turn in early, while the bard
and the dwarf decide to have a drink.

When they finally decide to call it a night, they feel a sudden drop in temperature. The dwarf decides to investigate.
As he attempts to look out the front door a shadow leaps out at him trying to pull him into the darkness. Thorin jumps
back, just in time. More shadows start to swarm the inn, snaking through the windows and gaps in the wall. They try to
swarm and overpower the dwarf.

The rest of the party joins the battle and help fend off the shadows, with fire and radiant light, before they can leech
all life from Thorin.

After another narrow brush with death, they decide to turn in for the night, while taking turns to keep watch.

</details>

### Wed 21 August 2019

<details>
<summary> Fourteenth session: Looking for treasure</summary>

#### 4th of Flamerule 1453

After an argument about where to go next, the party decides to head down the Cairn road to backtrack to the Stone
Monastery. They want to get back to the fire temple to put a stop to the waves of enemies being sent after them.

On their way down the Cairn Road, they spot a patrol coming from the opposite direction. An ambush is layed. The group
springs their trap on two Fire Elemental Myrmidons, sent to patrol the road to Red Larch.

After killing the first elemental, Peren uses Tinderstrike to dominate the second elemental. He extracts information
about the surrounding area and the location of the entrace to the fire temple, before banishing the elemental back to
its home plane.

The group camps out for night, off the road.

#### 5th of Flamerule 1453

Using intel gleaned from the dominated fire elemental, the party heads off to find the entrace to the fire temple,
located at Scarlet Moon Hall.

On their way the party spots a large black beast flying through the cloud to the North-West. A great, big, black dragon
is making its way across the valley. It either doesn't spot the party or it pays them no mind as flies far overhead.

After a few hours of trekking across the Dessarin Valley grassland and into the Sumber Hills, the party finds a burnt
out tower on the top of a hill. A single sentry patrols up and down the main path leading to the Scarlet Moon Hall. They
dazzle and dispatch of the fire elemental sentry with ease.

The group makes their way into the bombed out ruins, where they discover a tunnel leading underground. They descend into
darkness and arrive at one of the entrances of the Temple of the Eternal Flame.

On their approach to Scarlet Moon Hall, Yasheira starts hearing the eerie laughter she last heard when escaping from the
underground compound. Using the laughter as a guide the party makes their way to Bastion's private quaters, via a secret
door in one of the temple tunnels.

The group finds a strange wardrobe, with no door, in Bastion's chambers. Upon revealing the Bastion's key, the facade of
the wardrobe turns into a face matching that on the key. Yasheira places the key into its mouth. The key disappears as a
crease forms down the middle of the wardrobe. Yarsheira opens the wardrobe. Inside, there is a thick velvet curtain.
Yasheira starts rummaging around behind the curtain and pulls out a robe, a cloak and two rings.

A red robe covered in eyes; a black cloak with a bat embroidered on the collar; a ring with two ram's heads on the
front; A ring in the shape of a feather.

</details>

### Wed 11 September 2019

<details>
<summary> Fifthteenth session: </summary>

#### 5th of Flamerule 1453

The loot is divided and the party sets of, exploring the upper level of the fire dungeon.

The area seems abandoned. Rooms have been stripped down, with only things deemed too heavy to carry being left behind.

Further exploration of the dungeon complex reveals a few interesting landmarks: A large fiery butthole-shaped chasm,
with a floating stone elevator; a cache of supplies, hidden behind a false wall; a room full of toxic mold; a very large
pile of junk; a room full of gears, which controls the flow of lava in the forge area; and a room full of hellhounds,
who nearly killed the bard.

Moonpie steals a coin, from Thorin, to throw in the fiery lake. Perhaps some long-forgotten lava diety deems this a
sufficient sacrifice?

</details>

### Wed 18 September 2019

<details>
<summary> Sixteenth session: </summary>

The group decides to rest after their day of exploration.

#### 6th of Flamerule 1453

Further exploration of the dungeon reveals nothing of interest.

It seems that it is time to go down further into the temple complex. The butthole chasm seem to be the best course of
action. The party makes their way to the elevator and try to figure out how to operate it.

With Peren's newfound knowledge of the Ignan language and some runes on the elevator, the group figures out how to take
the elevator down into the bowels of the complex.

They go down. All the way down.

The elevator arrives at a lake of magma, surrounded by tunnels. The Area is heavily guarded by cultists and fire giant.
The party barely survives the encounter. Maybe they have gone too far...

</details>

### Wed 27 September 2019

<details>
<summary> Seventeenth session: The Fane of the Eye; Spooky hammer</summary> 
After their previous encounter in the bowels of the underground city, the party decides to double back, up the lift, to
the upper levels of the complex.

After regrouping and patching themselves up they decide to go down the lift; this time only one level.

The area starts to look familiar to Thorin and Peren. They have been here before...

They had encountered many oddities on this level, including two hill giants playing tic-tac-toe; a collapsed mine; fire
breathing minotaurs; an ominous chamber containing a drow statue, sealed off by oily smoke etc. Unfortunately this was
some time ago, and they had forgotten most of what had transpired

The group decides to start exploring the cavernous chambers. It doesn't take long for them to find trouble, in the form
of the remaining fire cult minotaur. He never stood a chance.

The party makes their way deeper into the tunnels, arriving at the collapsed mine. Still infested with ghosts. After
dispatching with the hostile spectres a dwarven apparition appears, pointing towards a pile of collapse stonework.

Thorin starts digging through the rubble, revealing the haft of a large hammer. The name Hendrel is emblazoned on the
side. Thorin recognizes this as a dwarven thrower.

</details>

### Wed 2 October 2019

<details>
<summary> Eighteenth session: The Fane of the Eye Part II</summary> 
The squad of merry <s>fucks</s> adventurers start clearing out the dungeon, room by room. With each area, Thorin and 
Peren start to recognise more of the cavernous chambers. They wander into a room where they previously encountered
two hill giants, finding only two giant skeletons. Upon further investigation of the skeletons it is revealed that the 
room is infested with gigantic carrion crawlers, as they start falling from the ceiling.

\<Insert epic combat description here \>

After dealing with the carrion crawlers, the party makes their way to an adjacent chamber, segregated by magical fog
barriers and with a creepily hunched over statue at it's centre. The hulking mass has a large gem for an eye. 

Moonpie wants to take the gem. The rest of the party is however able to dissuade her, as they are convinced it is
some kind of trap. Instead of tempting fate, they make their way back to the dwarven tomb to rest.

<summary> Nineteenth session: The Fane of the Eye Part III</summary>

Explorations continue. The gang makes their best effort to avoid danger as they map out the rest of this level of 
the underground complex: 

   - Large chamber filled with fungus and potentially toxic mushrooms? Nope. 
   - Hang around in a room with what appears to be a demonic summoning circle? Nuh-uh.
   - Open up a sarcophagus covered in demonic friezes and elemental symbols? Hell naw. 
   - Destroy a sacrificial alter dedicated to some elemental evil? Nein.
   - Destroy the drow statue with a large crystal eye? That's going to have be a no from me, dawg.

During their explorations the party rescue a local commoner, Darreth. He is from the town of Womford. He was captured by
cultists during a nightime raid on his hometown. The group rescues him by interrupting a sacrificial ritual. Gar, the 
leader of the water cultists decides to abandon the ritual when the group arrives. He is well aware of the danger
that they pose; seeing that more than one of the cult leaders has already fallen to them in battle.

The party decides to escort Darreth out of the dungeon complex. Leading him back up through the stone temple, to the 
Sacred Stone Monastery. He isn't quick to trust the party, but is willing to take any help he can get.
