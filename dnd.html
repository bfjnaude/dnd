Meanwhile the druid and monk decided to use the inn’s remaining supplies to make a stew in a large couldron hanging in the inn’s hearth.</p>
<p>After the merry making and supper, the group decide to hold up in one of the inn’s larger rooms, on the second floor, for the night.</p>
<h4 id="rd-of-flamerule-1453">3rd of Flamerule 1453</h4>
<p>Getting an early start, the party starts to loot the rest of the towns ruins for supplies. They equip themselves with any clothes and adventuring gear they are able to find in workshops and traders supplies which were abandoned during the evacuation of Red Larch.</p>
<p>While they are busy looting, a fire giant enters the town. Yasheira is quick on the uptake and alerts the party of the giant’s presence. The giant starts to search the town, ripping the roofs off houses and beckoning whomever is hiding to come out and give him Tinderstrike. He seems aware of the dagger’s presence.</p>
<p>The party stays in hiding and springs their ambush from inside a general trader’s store. Using a combination of stuns, confusion and summoned creatures the party is able to overwhelm the giant before he can deal any serious damage, with the dwarf delivering the final blow.</p>

<p><summary> Thirteenth session: It’s getting hot in here </summary></p>
<h4 id="rd-of-flamerule-1453-1">3rd of Flamerule 1453</h4>
<p>The gang decides to set off to the North, with plans to make their way to Neverwinter via the Triboar trail.</p>
<p>Not long after starting the long trek across the Dessarin Valley, they spot large columns of smoke on the horizon. It soon becomes apparent that a wild fire is blazing across the Sumber Hills, travelling in their direction. The air starts to become acrid and the sky becomes dark and hazy as the wall of fire, stretching from West to East as far as they can see, approaches.</p>
<p>The party decides to run back to Red Larch, to escape the approaching inferno. During their retreat they notice that a column of fire is approaching from the West. Not long after, they spot a fiery flying streak in to the East, followed by a trail of fire on the ground. Something is trying to burn down the valley.</p>
<p>With some encouraging words from the bard, the group picks up the pace to attempt to avoid whatever is trying to trap them in the inferno.</p>
<p>The encounter comes to a head, with the party narrowly escaping a strafing run by a red dragon, wreathed in flame.</p>
<p>Combat ensues, with Thorin launching crossbow bolts; Moonpie hurling magical beams of frost and lightning; Peren dazzling and confusing the dragon with psychic song; and Yasheira delivering stunning, ki empowered, strikes. This young red dragon seems to alternate between a physical and elemental form, rendering many of the party’s attacks ineffective.</p>
<p>The dragon gets in a few devastating blows with its claws and nearly kills the druid with its fire breath, before being slain. The final blow is delivered by Peren, wielding Tinderstrike. The dragon dies in a bright explosion, as the dagger is plunged into its hide. The group is blinded, deafened and knocked backwards by the blast. Peren’s arm is left scorched black and pulsing with fiery veins. All that remains of the dragon is a charred skeleton.</p>
<p>After slaying the dragon the gang continues their retreat to Red Larch. They must devise another plan if they are to escape the Dessarin Valley.</p>
<p>They decide to, once again, take refuge in the Swinging Sword Inn. The druid and the monk turn in early, while the bard and the dwarf decide to have a drink.</p>
<p>When they finally decide to call it a night, they feel a sudden drop in temperature. The dwarf decides to investigate. As he attempts to look out the front door a shadow leaps out at him trying to pull him into the darkness. Thorin jumps back, just in time. More shadows start to swarm the inn, snaking through the windows and gaps in the wall. They try to swarm and overpower the dwarf.</p>
<p>The rest of the party joins the battle and help fend off the shadows, with fire and radiant light, before they can leech all life from Thorin.</p>
<p>After another narrow brush with death, they decide to turn in for the night, while taking turns to keep watch.</p>

<p><summary> Fourteenth session: Looking for treasure</summary></p>
<h4 id="th-of-flamerule-1453">4th of Flamerule 1453</h4>
<p>After an argument about where to go next, the party decides to head down the Cairn road to backtrack to the Stone Monastery. They want to get back to the fire temple to put a stop to the waves of enemies being sent after them.</p>
<p>On their way down the Cairn Road, they spot a patrol coming from the opposite direction. An ambush is layed. The group springs their trap on two Fire Elemental Myrmidons, sent to patrol the road to Red Larch.</p>
<p>After killing the first elemental, Peren uses Tinderstrike to dominate the second elemental. He extracts information about the surrounding area and the location of the entrace to the fire temple, before banishing the elemental back to its home plane.</p>
<p>The group camps out for night, off the road.</p>
<h4 id="th-of-flamerule-1453-1">5th of Flamerule 1453</h4>
<p>Using intel gleaned from the dominated fire elemental, the party heads off to find the entrace to the fire temple, located at Scarlet Moon Hall.</p>
<p>On their way the party spots a large black beast flying through the cloud to the North-West. A great, big, black dragon is making its way across the valley. It either doesn’t spot the party or it pays them no mind as flies far overhead.</p>
<p>After a few hours of trekking across the Dessarin Valley grassland and into the Sumber Hills, the party finds a burnt out tower on the top of a hill. A single sentry patrols up and down the main path leading to the Scarlet Moon Hall. They dazzle and dispatch of the fire elemental sentry with ease.</p>
<p>The group makes their way into the bombed out ruins, where they discover a tunnel leading underground. They descend into darkness and arrive at one of the entrances of the Temple of the Eternal Flame.</p>
<p>On their approach to Scarlet Moon Hall, Yasheira starts hearing the eerie laughter she last heard when escaping from the underground compound. Using the laughter as a guide the party makes their way to Bastion’s private quaters, via a secret door in one of the temple tunnels.</p>
<p>The group finds a strange wardrobe, with no door, in Bastion’s chambers. Upon revealing the Bastion’s key, the facade of the wardrobe turns into a face matching that on the key. Yasheira places the key into its mouth. The key disappears as a crease forms down the middle of the wardrobe. Yarsheira opens the wardrobe. Inside, there is a thick velvet curtain. Yasheira starts rummaging around behind the curtain and pulls out a robe, a cloak and two rings.</p>
<p>A red robe covered in eyes; a black cloak with a bat embroidered on the collar; a ring with two ram’s heads on the front; A ring in the shape of a feather.</p>

<p><summary> Fifthteenth session: </summary></p>
<h4 id="th-of-flamerule-1453-2">5th of Flamerule 1453</h4>
<p>The loot is divided and the party sets of, exploring the upper level of the fire dungeon.</p>
<p>The area seems abandoned. Rooms have been stripped down, with only things deemed too heavy to carry being left behind.</p>
<p>Further exploration of the dungeon complex reveals a few interesting landmarks: A large fiery butthole-shaped chasm, with a floating stone elevator; a cache of supplies, hidden behind a false wall; a room full of toxic mold; a very large pile of junk; a room full of gears, which controls the flow of lava in the forge area; and a room full of hellhounds, who nearly killed the bard.</p>
Moonpie steals a coin, from Thorin, to throw in the fiery lake. Perhaps some long-forgotten lava diety deems this a sufficient sacrifice?

<p><summary> Sixteenth session: </summary></p>
<p>The group decides to rest after their day of exploration.</p>
<h4 id="th-of-flamerule-1453-3">6th of Flamerule 1453</h4>
<p>Further exploration of the dungeon reveals nothing of interest.</p>
<p>It seems that it is time to go down further into the temple complex. The butthole chasm seem to be the best course of action. The party makes their way to the elevator and try to figure out how to operate it.</p>
<p>With Peren’s newfound knowledge of the Ignan language and some runes on the elevator, the group figures out how to take the elevator down into the bowels of the complex.</p>
<p>They go down. All the way down.</p>
<p>The elevator arrives at a lake of magma, surrounded by tunnels. The Area is heavily guarded by cultists and fire giant. The party barely survives the encounter. Maybe they have gone too far…</p>
