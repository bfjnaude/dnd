The party spends the day treking into the Sumber Hills. By the late afternoon they are ready to start making camp when they spot 
fiery streaks running down from the sky, like a waterfall, just over the next hill.

If they investigate they find two Fire Elemental Myrmidons posted outside the Scarlett Moon Hall.
