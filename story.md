# Intro hook
Each of the characters find themselves at an inn at the edge of the Dessarin valley. 

Elliania Lycaon is searching for her master in the valley, after finding a cryptic note "Find Klymene. Danger".
Klymene, a brass dragon and friend, told her that her master, Anton Nicolau, went East to invesigate a great magical disturbance in the Dessarin Valley.

Coldor Westerfield heard rumors of magical anomalies and groups of weird pilgrims, following the unearthing or powerful artifacts, South of Yartar. Being an inquisitive wizard he finds himself drawn east from Neverwinter to Dessarin Valley.

Shava Illiai is on the hunt for rare ingredients needed for a potion for one of her special patrons. Footnotes in an old tome leads her to West of the Dessarin River.

The characters seek shelter at a local in Westbridge after a storm starts to kick up...
